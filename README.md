# StringFilter
Subst16 is a pseudo string rewriting filter that reads lines from standard input and performs the given, viable substitutions and writes the modified input to standard output. Subst16 accepts three types of arguments in the order of [FROM TO FLAGS]: the FROM argument is the string to replace, the TO argument is the replacement string, and the FLAGS argument is the application of the substitution rule (either through quit, global, or rescan). The FLAGS argument also accepts Sm or Fn arguments, which applies the mth or nth number rule (if such a rule exists). Lastly, the FROM argument accepts a wildcard ., which will match any character. The TO argument accepts a char ^, which represents the replaced FROM string.
